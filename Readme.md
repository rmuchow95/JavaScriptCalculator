**Summary**

This is my seventh project, created entirely with vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS. With this application, I learned how to utilize Flex Box in my CSS file. This javascript calculator application also challenged my logic skills in new ways; after completing this application, I feel more skilled in creating clean and efficient code.
